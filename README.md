# Chatbot Application

Welcome to **R Chatbot**, a Django-based chatbot application that integrates OpenAI's API to provide intelligent, dynamic, and context-aware conversations. This project utilizes OpenAI's state-of-the-art models like `gpt-3.5-turbo` (or available models) to deliver high-quality responses.

## Features

- **Django Backend**: Robust and scalable backend powered by Django.
- **AI-Powered Conversations**: Uses OpenAI's GPT models for intelligent responses.
- **Dynamic Context Handling**: Generates context-aware, human-like replies.
- **Easy to Customize**: Adaptable for different domains and use cases.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python**: 3.12+
- **Django**: 5.1+
- **OpenAI Python Library**: 0.27 or newer
- An OpenAI API key ([sign up here](https://platform.openai.com/signup)).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot-app.git
   cd chatbot-app
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up OpenAI API Key**:
   Create an `.env` file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

5. **Run Database Migrations**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Start the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Usage

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
2. Type your message in the chat interface.
3. Receive an AI-powered response generated by OpenAI's models.

## How It Works

The chatbot uses the OpenAI API to process user inputs and generate intelligent responses. Here’s an overview of the process:

1. **User Input**: The user enters a message in the chat.
2. **OpenAI API Call**: The message is sent to OpenAI's API along with conversation context.
3. **Response Generation**: The API returns a response, which is displayed in the chat interface.

Example OpenAI API call:
```python
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",  # Replace with the model ID you're using
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful chatbot."},
        {"role": "user", "content": user_message},
    ],
    max_tokens=150,
    temperature=0.7,
)
```

## Future Enhancements

- **Extended UI**: Build a more user-friendly frontend.
- **Custom Prompts**: Allow users to customize the chatbot’s tone or behavior.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Add support for conversations in multiple languages.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Model Errors**: Ensure the selected model (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo`) is available in your OpenAI account.
- **API Key Issues**: Double-check your `.env` file for the correct API key.
- **Rate Limits**: Be aware of usage limits on your OpenAI account. Monitor usage in the [OpenAI Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/usage).
